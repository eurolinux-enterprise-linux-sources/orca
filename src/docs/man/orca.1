.SH SYNOPSIS
.B orca
.RI [ option... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B orca 
is a screen reader for people with visual impairments,
and provides alternative access to the desktop by making use
of speech synthesis, braille, and magnification  support on
the platform.
.P
In addition, 
.B orca 
only provides access to
applications/toolkits that support the assistive technology
service provide interface (AT-SPI), which include GTK,
Mozilla, Firefox, Evolution, OpenOffice, StarOffice,
Java/Swing, etc.
.P
WARNING: suspending 
.B orca,
e.g. by pressing Control-Z, from
an AT-SPI enabled shell (such as gnome-terminal), can also
suspend the desktop until Orca is killed.
